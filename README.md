#Even Fibonacci Numbers

##Challenge 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. To retrieve all dependecies, run the command: `npm install`
3. Your work will be done in the file named: `even_fib_nums.js`
4. Run your test with the command: `npm test`
5. There are two tests total, when you are done with one un-comment the other.
6. The second test is broken, fix it!

## Caveats
The function should return the sum of all the even numbers in the fibonacci sequence where the value of the term does not exceed **n**.

Remember, **n** is not how many numbers in the fibonacci sequence, it is the **max value, the last term in a fibonacci sequence** where you will then add up all **even** numbers.
